The project is an E-commerce website built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It provides a platform for users to view and purchase various products. The server-side (Node.js with Express) manages the API for product data stored in a MongoDB database. The client-side (React) handles the user interface and interacts with the server to fetch and display product information.
